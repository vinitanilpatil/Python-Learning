Let's Start !

#String Slicing :- Ex. mystr = "Vinit Is So Hardworking"
                       print(mystr[0:5])
                   Output = Vinit
                   
                   Ex. mystr = "Vinit Is So Lazy Actually !"
                       print(mystr[0:5:2])
                   Output = Vnt
                   
                   Ex. mystr = "The Last Example, Because You May Have Read Above Examples.."
                       print(mystr[::2])
                   Output = TeLs xml,BcueYuMyHv edAoeEape.
                   
                   Ex. mystr = "Aah This is Too boring there are more examples."
                       print(mystr[-4:-2])
                   Output = le
                   
                   Alright I Will Make This Easy
                   
                                                                                               Positive :- 0123456
                   For Example This Is Your String, See Thier Number Of Positions (Negative & Positive) :- Hey, Hi
                                                                                               Negative :- 7654321
                                                                                               
                   Note That The Below Numbers Are Negative If You Are Going To Use Those Add A Minus Sign Before Them Like This -2, -3, -6.
                   
                   
                   
Related Functions = len() - shows the length of string in integer (counting starts from 0)
                    isalnum() - returns false if there are spaces in your integer and true if there are not.
                    isalpha() - returns false if there are spaces in your string and true if there are not.
                    endsWith() - Lemme Tell You This With An Quick Example :- str = "This Is An Example"
                                                                              print(str.endsWith("Example"))

                    startsWith() - Lemme Tell You This One Also With An Quick Example :- str = "This Is An Example No.2"
                                                                                         print(str.startsWith("This"))
                                                                               Output :- true
                    count() - Ex. str = "Examples are the best thing lol"
                                  print(str.count("e"))
                        Output :- 3
                        
                    capitalize() - Capitalizes The First Letter Of String

                    lower() - Makes The Whole String Lowercase
                    upper() - Makes The Whole String Uppercase
                    replace() - Ex. str = "Typing Gets Boring Sometimes.."
                                    print(str.replace("Gets", "is getting"))
                          Output :- Typing is getting Boring Sometimes..
                          
                    There are more functions related to string you can see them by.. just type python string methods in google i am not gonna waste my whole day in just typing.
                    
                    
                    Bye !
