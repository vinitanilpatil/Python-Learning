# Loops :- 
          1] For Loop
          2] While Loop
          
          For Loops - I Will Explain It With A Examples (You Know The Reason If You Saw My Previous SELF-STUDY NOTES.)
                      
                  Ex. list1 = ["Hey", "How", "Are", "You ?"]
                      list2 = ["No", "One", "Cares !"]
                      
                      for item in list1:
                          print(item)
                      for item in list2:
                          print(item)
                          
             Output:- Hey
                      How
                      Are
                      You ?
                      No
                      One
                      Cares !
                      
                      
                      
          While Loops - So This One Easy But Still I Am Going To Explain (MYSELF) By A EXAMPLE
                        
                  Ex. i = 1
                      while(i < 45):
                          print(i)
                          i = i + 1
                          
            Output - 0

                     Oh Ok That's All For Today
