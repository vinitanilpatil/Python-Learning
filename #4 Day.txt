# Dictionary & It's Functions :-
                                To make a dictionary = Ex. d1 = {"Vinit":"Burger", "Rohan":"Fish", "Rohit":"Roti"}
                                                           print(d1["Vinit"])
                                                 Output :- Burger
                                                 
                                Nested Dictionary = Ex. d1 = {"Vinit":{"Lunch":"Burger", "Dinner":"CheeseBurger"}} (Coz I Like Burgers hehe)
                                                        print(d1["Vinit"]["Dinner"])
                                              Output :- CheeseBurger
                                              
                                Removing An Element From Dictionary = del d1["Vinit"]         (This Will Delete Element "Vinit" From List)
                                
                                Adding Element To A Dictionary = dictionaryName.update({"Element":"Value"})
                                
                                To Just Display The Elements  = dictionaryName.keys() & .items() To Display The Values...
                                
                                
# If, Elif, Else :-
                    I Am Going To Explain This Whole Thing With Only Examples (And A Same Example) ........ Coz I Don't Like To Talk More
                    
                    // These Are Three Variables I Will Be Using In This Whole If Else Thing
                Ex. first = 6
                    second = 78
                    inp = input()
                    
      Condition :-  if inp > first:
      Statement :-      print("Greater")
                    else:                                              PS :- To Write A Statement Always Leave A Tab Of Space Or Error Will Occur 
                        print("Smaller")                                     That Greater Than Sign Is Called An Operator (Maybe) There Are More Operators
         
         
          OPERATORS == 1] "="  = Assignment Operator (Actually I Don't Know What It Does)
                       2] "==" = Is Equal To
                       3] "=>" = Equal To OR Greator Than
                       4] "<=" = Equal To OR Lesser Than
                       5] "|"  = OR
                       6] "!=" = Not Equal To
                       7] "&"  = And
                       8] "%"  = Modulus (Divides The Given Two Numbers & Return Remainder)
                       9] "/"  = Divide
                      10] "*"  = Multiply
                      11] "+"  = Add
                      12] "-"  = Substract
                      
                      These Are Only Some Of Those Which I Knew I Think There Are 2-3 More
                      Just Search It In Google (Coz U Know I Am A Bit Lazy Right ?)
                      
                      
                      Bye !
