Let's Start !

#Comments :- Single line comment tag   = # this is a single line comment
             Multiple line comment tag = """ This is a multi line comment (maybe i didn't wrote it as multi line lol) """
             
[I will not explain everything, but i will provide examples that explains more than my words. Uf why am i writing this much when i know only i am the one who's gonna read this !]

                                                   ----------------------------------
                                                  |Example = print("Hello" end="! ") |
                                                  |          print("How are you ?")  |
                                                  |                                  |
                                                  |Output  = Hello! How are you ?    |
                                                   ----------------------------------

#Escape Sequences :- 1) \n  = To make a new line
                    2) \\n = If you want to display \n
                    3) \t  = leave a tab (space)
                    
#DataTypes :- 1) Boolean       = True or False
              2) Integer [int] = 1,2,3.....
              3) Float         = 1.5, 3.7, 5.6.....
              4) String [str]  = "This is a string"
Tip :- You can use **type()** function to print a variable's type
       There is a **str()** function to convert a float or integer into a string. Similarly there are two more functions - **int()** and **float()**
       Also there is a **input()** function to take input from the user
       
    
       
That is all for today (bcoz i am a little bit lazy)
