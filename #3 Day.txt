Let's Start !

# Lists :- 

           Ex. fruits = ["Apple", "Mango", "Banana", "Strawberry", "Pineapple"]
               print(fruits)
     Output :- ["Apple", "Mango", "Banana", "Strawberry", "Pineapple"]
     
           Ex. fruits = ["Apple", "Mango", "Banana", "Strawberry", "Pineapple"]
               print(fruits[1])
     Output :- Mango
     
     
           It Should Have Output Apple Above Shouldn't it ?
           That's Because Counting Starts From 0 In Python
           Apple's Position Is 0 And Mango's Is 1 (Mango Is My Fav Fruit BTW)
           
           
Related Function = sort() - Ex. num = [12, 3, 5, 2, 16]
                                num.sort()
                                print(num)
                      Output :- [2, 3, 5, 12, 16]
                      
                   reverse() - reverses the whole list
                   max() - Prints Biggest Numbers From The List
                   min() - Prints Smallest Numbers From The List
                   append() - adds the given value at the end of the list
                   insert() - adds the given value at the given position....  Usage = listName.insert(position, value)
                   remove() - removes the given value from the list (Works Only If The Given Value Is Available In The List)
                   pop() - removes the last element from the list
                   
                   
Tip = Lists Are Mutable Means You Can Change Them But Tuples Are Immutable You Cannot Change Them, To Make Tuple Just Use () Instead Of []

                  
                  To Know More List Related Functions Just Search It In Google Coz I Am A Bit Lazy As You Know...,
                  
                  
                  Bye !
